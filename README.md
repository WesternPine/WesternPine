## Why "WesternPine"? 🌲

Picture a mountainous landscape... chances are there's a Western White Pine in there somewhere. These trees are in almost every painting and picture of nature because they are one of the fastest growing, most environmentally diversified, and adaptive plants in existence. In other words, they are extremely successful, and I strive to be as well.
